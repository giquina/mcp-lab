## üîê Security & Best Practices

- **API Keys**: Store in environment variables, never commit to version control
- **Docker**: Run MCPs in isolated containers when possible
- **Testing**: Always test on simulators before real devices
- **Version Control**: Use GitHub MCP for proper version management
- **Documentation**: Keep Notion updated with all project decisions
